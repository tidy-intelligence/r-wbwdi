)
```

```{r setup}
library(wdi2)
```

The `wdi2` package provides a modern and flexible interface for accessing the World Bankâ€™s [World Development Indicators (WDI)](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/). It improves upon existing packages by utilizing the `httr2` package for multi-page requests and enhanced error handling. With `wdi2`, you can download data for multiple indicators and countries in a single function call, benefit from progress bars, and receive the output in a tidy data format, making it ideal for further analysis.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `wdi2` from CRAN via:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("wdi2")
```

To install the development version of `wdi2`, use:

```{r}
#| eval: false
pak::pak("tidy-intelligence/r-wdi2")
```

## Listing supported indicators

The `wdi2` package allows you to retrieve a full list of all supported indicators from the World Bank [Indicators API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation). Each indicator is accompanied by metadata such as its unit of measurement, source, and associated topics.

```{r}
# Retrieve the list of supported indicators
list_supported_indicators()
```

If you want to get more details such as source ID and topics, you can use the corresponding option:

```{r}
# Retrieve the list of supported indicators with details
list_supported_indicators(include_details = TRUE)
```

You can also get the list of supported indicators in a different language, or omit the progress bar. For example, to retrieve the indicators in Spanish:

```{r}
# Retrieve indicators in Spanish
list_supported_indicators(language = "es", include_details = TRUE, progress = FALSE)
```

To get the list of supported languages, call: 

```{r}
# List supported languages
list_supported_languages()
```

Note that not all indicators might be translated into all languages. 

## Listing supported Countries

You can retrieve a list of all countries supported by the World Bank API along with metadata such as region, administrative region, income level, and lending type.

```{r}
# Retrieve the list of supported countries
list_supported_countries()
```

This information can also be requested in other languages. For example, to view the supported countries in Chinese:

```r
# Retrieve countries in Chinese
list_supported_countries(language = "zh")
```

### Downloading indicator data

With `wdi2`, you can download indicator data for multiple countries and indicators in a single function call. The function returns a tidy data frame with country, indicator, date, and value columns.

For example, to download GDP per capita and total population for Mexico, Canada, and the United States:

```{r}
# Download specific indicators for selected countries
download_indicators(countries = c("MX", "CA", "US"), indicators = c("NY.GDP.PCAP.KD", "SP.POP.TOTL"))
```

If you need the same indicators for all countries, you can pass `"all"` as the `countries` parameter:

```r
# Download indicators for all countries
download_indicators(countries = "all", indicators = c("NY.GDP.PCAP.KD", "SP.POP.TOTL"))
```

## Conclusion

The `wdi2` package is designed to simplify the process of accessing and analyzing World Bank data. By offering features like multi-indicator downloads, progress bars, and flexible language support, `wdi2` is a robust tool for users who need access to World Development Indicators in a modern, tidy format.

If you encounter any errors or have suggestions for improvements, please consider opening an issue in the package repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/tidy-intelligence/r-wdi2/issues).
